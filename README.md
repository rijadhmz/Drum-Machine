## Drum Machine

This project involves a React application that functions as a "Drum Machine." It was developed as part of the FreeCodeCamp "Front End Development Libraries" course certification.

### Project Description

The Drum Machine is an interactive web application built using React. The application provides users with the ability to play different drum sounds by clicking on drum pad elements or using keyboard keys. It offers a playful and engaging way to create rhythm and experiment with various sounds.

### Challenge Requirement

The challenge required building an app that fulfills the following user stories:

1. The app contains an outer container with the id "drum-machine."
2. Within the container, there is an element with the id "display."
3. There are nine clickable drum pad elements, each representing a sound and having a unique id and inner text corresponding to a keyboard key.
4. Each drum pad contains an HTML5 audio element with a class name "clip," a src attribute pointing to an audio clip, and an id corresponding to the inner text.
5. Clicking on a drum pad or pressing the associated keyboard key triggers the audio clip.
6. The display element shows a string describing the associated audio clip when a drum pad is triggered.

### Implementation Details

The project utilizes React to create a user-friendly interface. Drum pad elements can be clicked or triggered via keyboard input, allowing users to explore and play sounds. Event listeners for both mouse clicks and keyboard input were implemented. The audio elements play the corresponding drum sounds, and the display updates to show the name of the played sound.

### Technologies Used

- React
- Bootstrap (for styling)
- HTML5 Audio
